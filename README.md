# SQL_Project

This repository contains SQL files showcasing my hands-on practice with various data skills. 

You'll find examples of data cleaning, transformations, and queries I've worked on to sharpen my SQL skills. 

It's a collection of real-world scenarios designed to demonstrate my ability to work with databases efficiently and effectively :D
